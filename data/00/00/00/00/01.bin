    Berlin, 2048 – The world is on the brink. Lack of resources, illnesses
    caused by polluted air and water, crime on the rise, war. Governments
    and companies promise remedies through technological progress. Drones
    and humanoid robots replace humans in the public sector, everything is
    interconnected, surveillance has become omnipresent.

    Richard Nolan is one of the few journalists openly criticizing this 
    development. When he wakes up in hospital after an explosion and finds
    that his wife and son have mysteriously vanished, Richard realizes: he
    and his family have become more than just bystanders in a storm of 
    rivaling ideas pertaining to humankinds salvation between dystopian
    reality and digital utopia. Instead, they find themselves right at the
    center of it.

    This domestic drama evolves into a thriller about a worldwide 
    conspiracy, which at its core aims to determine the fate of humanity:
    Could a perfect digital utopia be the answer? A virtual paradise not
    affected by material needs and quarrels? Could a super-AI be our 
    savior – or would it simply declare us as dispensable since it could 
    not be taught the value of philanthropy?

    What will the world look like after this storm, what will remain of 
    humanity?

    Features:
    - Experience an alarmingly realistic vision of the near future
    - Dive into a multi-layered Sci-Fi thriller, where dystopian reality
      and digital utopia are intertwined
    - Unravel a global conspiracy in a society of ubiquitous digitalism,
      surveillance and transhumanism
    - Explore a world with a rich and unique visual style, combining 
      realistic environments with low-poly characters
    - Take on the role of journalist Richard Nolan, as well as five 
      additional playable characters
    - Use dexterity, deductional skill and research to reconstruct 
      Richards past
